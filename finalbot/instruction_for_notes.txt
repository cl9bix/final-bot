Hi!
This is a simple instruction for Notes-mode.
Here you can write and save any yours information.

For ADD new note write 'add' and after start write what you want
(ofcourse, if you need hashtags - use it!)
Warning: use Enter only for save note

If you want change note: print "Change", name of note and new information.
For remove note you can use command "remove" and print the name of note.

Forgot the name of note? Use commands 'show all', 'find' or 'search' - for hashtags.

For help - print "help"
For exit print -"return"
